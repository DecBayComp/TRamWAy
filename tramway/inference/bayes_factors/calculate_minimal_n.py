    """
    Calculate the minimal number of jumps per bin to obtain strong evidence for a conservative or a spurious force in the Bayes factor.

    Input:
    zeta_t, zeta_sp --- vectors of length 2 (x, y) in one bin
    n0 --- initial number of jumps (evidence already available). This way the "next" strong evidence can be found, i.e. the minimal number of data points to support the current conclusion

    Output:
    min_n --- minimal number of jumps to obtain strong evidence for the conservative force model.
    Return -1 if unable to find the min_n
