|tramway| is a tool to analyse single molecule dynamics from their locations or trajectories.

Parameters of single molecule dynamics such as diffusivity, drift, force and potential energy can be estimated across space and time.
Maps of these parameters are thus generated and additional tools such as curl calculation for force maps may extract further information about the dynamics.

|tramway| has been designed as a modular Python library that may accomodate additional plugins for the main processing steps, namely the tessellation and inference steps.

The full code is distributed under :ref:`CeCILL license <license>` and is available at `github`_.


--------
Features
--------

* spatial :ref:`tessellation <tessellation>` and temporal segmentation
* :ref:`inference <inference>` of diffusivity, drift, force and potential energy
* analyses of the estimated force, such as curl calculation and `Bayes factor <https://github.com/DecBayComp/TRamWAy/tree/bayes_factor>`_ calculation to distinguish interactions and spurious forces
* and more: generation of random trajectories, plotting utilities, etc



-------------
Quick example
-------------

Maps of diffusivity and potential energy estimates can be generated from molecule trajectories with as few as three commands:

.. code-block:: shell
	:linenos:

	tramway tessellate gwr -i trajectories.txt -o my-analyses.rwa
	tramway infer dv -i my-analyses.rwa
	tramway draw map -i my-analyses.rwa

* Single molecule locations and/or trajectories are usually stored in text files.
  In the above example, such an input file is named *trajectories.txt*.
* The first step (``1``) consists of importing these location data and tessellating the space into cells of adequate size. 
  The *GWR* method grows a graph that fits closely the molecule density.
* All the analyses derivating from a same dataset are stored in a single *.rwa* file.
* The second step (``2``) consists of infering parameters of the molecule dynamics,
  for example local diffusivities and potential energies (*DV* mode).
  This may take a while and recruit most of the processing units of the host.
* The estimated values can now be visualized as 2D maps (``3``).

The equivalent Python code is:

.. code-block:: python

	from tramway.helper import *

	tessellate('trajectories.txt', 'gwr', output_file='my-analyses.rwa')
	infer('my-analyses.rwa', 'dv')
	map_plot('my-analyses.rwa')
