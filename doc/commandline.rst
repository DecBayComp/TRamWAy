Command-line starter
====================

Input data
----------

The input data are tracking data of single molecules, stored in a text file.

The extension of input data files will usually be |txt|, |xyt| or |trxyt| but this is not required.

We will first import an example |trxyt| file and sample the molecule locations in a step referred to as "tessellation", before we perform the inference and feature extraction.

Note that there is no standalone import.
Molecule locations and trajectories should always be sampled in a way or another.

All the analyses derivating from a same dataset are stored in a single |rwa| file.

.. _commandline_tessellation:

Partitioning the data points
----------------------------

The first step consists of tessellating the space and partitioning the data points into the cells of the tessellation::

	> tramway tessellate -h
	> tramway tessellate kmeans -i example.trxyt -l kmeans

``-h`` shows the help message for the ``tessellate`` command. 

``-i`` takes the input data file, the ``kmeans`` subcommand is the tessellation method and ``-l`` specifies a label to attach to the analysis for further reference.

The available methods are:

* ``grid``: regular grid with equally sized square or cubic areas.
* ``kdtree``: kd-tree tessellation with midpoint splits.
* ``kmeans``: tessellation based on the k-means clustering algorithm.
* ``gwr`` (or ``gas``): tessellation based on the Growing-When-Required self-organizing gas.

``kmeans`` and ``gwr`` methods run optimization on the data and consequently are vulnerable to numerical scaling. 
It is recommended to scale your data adding the option ``-w``.

Each method exposes specific parameters.
Some parameters however apply after a mesh has been grown and therefore apply to all the methods.
Some of these parameters are ``--knn`` (or shorter ``-n``), ``--radius`` (or shorter ``-r``) and ``--strict-min-location-count`` (or shorter ``-ss``).

``--knn`` allows to impose a lower bound on the number of points (nearest neighbours) associated with each cell of the mesh, independently of the way the mesh has been grown.

Note that ``-n`` controls the minimum number of nearest neighbours and expands the cells if necessary.
To make all the cells contain a uniform number of points, the ``-N`` argument controls the maximum number
of nearest neighbours and can be set to the same value as ``-n``::

	> tramway tessellate gwr -i example.rwa -w -n 50 -N 50 -l gwr*

``--radius`` forces all the cells to be hyperspheres of uniform radius.
Values are specified in the units of the single molecule data, typically |um|.

With the above two arguments, some cells may overlap.

``--strict-min-location-count`` discards the cells that contain less locations than thereby specified.
Note that this filter applies before ``--knn``.
Cells with too few locations will be discarded anyway.

Other parameters directly affect the tessellation methods but can be found in all these methods.
The main such parameter is ``--distance`` (shorter ``-d``).
It drives how the cells scale and offers some degree of control over the distance between neighbour
cell centers, especially in dense areas.
Per default it is set to the average translocation distance.
A lower value may yield smaller cells.

The following example combines specified inter-cell distance (``-d``), sparse cell removal (``-ss``) and cell expansion to a minimum location number (``-n``)::

	> tramway tessellate gwr -i example.rwa -d 0.1 -ss 10 -n 30 -l gwr*

Note that, in the above two examples, the *example.rwa* file already exists and we add the meshes to the existing analysis tree.

The ``*`` symbol is replaced by the lowest available natural integer starting from 0.
This prevents from overwriting an analysis with the same label, if any.


You can check the content of the *example.rwa* file::

	> tramway dump -i example.rwa

	in example.rwa:
		<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
			'kmeans' <class 'tramway.tessellation.base.CellStats'>
			'gwr0' <class 'tramway.tessellation.base.CellStats'>
			'gwr1' <class 'tramway.tessellation.base.CellStats'>

Visualizing the partition
-------------------------

To visualize spatial 2D tessellations::

	> tramway draw cells -i example.rwa -L kmeans

To print the figure in an image file::

	> tramway draw cells -i example.rwa -L gwr0 -p png

This will generate an *example.png* file.

To overlay the Delaunay graph instead of the Voronoi graph::

	> tramway draw cells -i example.rwa -L gwr1 -D


.. _commandline_inference:

Inferring diffusivity and other parameters
------------------------------------------

Inferring diffusivity and force with the *DF* mode::

	> tramway infer df -i example.rwa -L kmeans -l df-map*

Other inference modes are *D* (``d``), *DD* (``dd``) and *DV* (``dv``).

A common parameter is the localization error, which default value is :math:`\sigma = 0.03 \textrm{Âµm}`.
See the :ref:`Common parameters section <inference_parameters>` to learn more about it.

*DV* is notably more time-consuming than the other inference modes and generates diffusivity and potential energy maps::

	> tramway infer dv -i example.rwa -L gwr1 -l dv-map*


.. seealso::

	:ref:`inference`


Visualizing maps
----------------

2D maps can be plotted with::

	> tramway draw map -i example.rwa -L gwr1,dv-map0

One can overlay the locations as white dots with high transparency over maps colored with one of the *matplotlib* supported colormaps (see also https://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html)::

	> tramway draw map -i example.rwa -L kmeans,df-map0 -cm jet -P size=1,color='w',alpha=.05


Extracting features
-------------------

The only feature available for now is curl for 2D force maps::

	> tramway extract curl -i example.rwa -L kmeans,df-map0 --radius 2 -l curl_2

For each cell, if a contour of successively adjacent cells can be found the curl is calculated along this contour and a map of local curl values can thus be extracted.

The optional ``radius`` argument drives the radius of the contour in number of cells.
At radius ``1`` the contour is formed by cells that are immediately adjacent to the center cell.
At radius ``2`` the contour is formed by cells that are adjacent to the radius-1 cells.
And so on.

Note that at higher radii the contours may partly consist of segments of lower-radii contours.

The extracted map can be plotted just like any map::

	> tramway draw map -i example.rwa -L kmeans,df-map0,curl_2
